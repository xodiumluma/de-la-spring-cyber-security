= What's New in Spring Security 6.3

Spring Security 6.3 provides a number of new features.
Below are the highlights of the release, or you can view https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/releases[the release notes] for a detailed listing of each feature and bug fix.

== Passive JDK Serialization Support

When it comes to its support for JDK-serialized security components, Spring Security has historically been quite aggressive, supporting each serialization version for only one Spring Security minor version.
This meant that if you had JDK-serialized security components, then they would need to be evacuated before upgrading to the next Spring Security version since they would no longer be deserializable.

Now that Spring Security performs a minor release every six months, this became a much larger pain point.
To address that, Spring Security now will https://spring.io/blog/2024/01/19/spring-security-6-3-adds-passive-jdk-serialization-deserialization-for[maintain passivity with JDK serialization], like it does with JSON serialization, making for more seamless upgrades.

== Authorization

An ongoing theme for the last several releases has been to refactor and improve Spring Security's authorization subsystem.
Starting with replacing the `AccessDecisionManager` API with `AuthorizationManager` it's now come to the point where we are able to add several exciting new features.

=== Annotation Parameters - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14480[#14480]

The first 6.3 feature is https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14480[support for annotation parameters].
Consider Spring Security's support for xref:servlet/authorization/method-security.adoc#meta-annotations[meta-annotations] like this one:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_message:read')")
public @interface HasMessageRead {}
----

Kotlin::
+
.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_message:read')")
annotation class HasMessageRead
----
======

Before this release, something like this is only helpful when it is used widely across the codebase.
But now, xref:servlet/authorization/method-security.adoc#_templating_meta_annotation_expressions[you can add parameters] like so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_{scope}')")
public @interface HasScope {
	String scope();
}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_{scope}')")
annotation class HasScope (val scope:String)
----
======

making it possible to do things like this:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@HasScope("message:read")
public String method() { ... }
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@HasScope("message:read")
fun method(): String { ... }
----
======

and apply your SpEL expression in several more places.

=== Secure Return Values - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14596[#14596], https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14597[#14597]

Since the early days of Spring Security, you've been able to xref:servlet/authorization/method-security.adoc#use-preauthorize[annotate Spring beans with `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize`].
But controllers, services, and repositories are not the only things you care to secure.
For example, what about a domain object `Order` where only admins should be able to call the `Order#getPayment` method?

Now in 6.3, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14597[you can annotate those methods], too.
First, annotate the `getPayment` method like you would a Spring bean:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
public class Order {

	@HasScope("payment:read")
	Payment getPayment() { ... }

}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
class Order {

	@HasScope("payment:read")
	fun getPayment(): Payment { ... }

}
----
======

And then xref:servlet/authorization/method-security.adoc#authorize-object[annotate your Spring Data repository with `@AuthorizeReturnObject`] like so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
public interface OrderRepository implements CrudRepository<Order, String> {

	@AuthorizeReturnObject
	Optional<Order> findOrderById(String id);

}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----

interface OrderRepository : CrudRepository<Order, String> {
    @AuthorizeReturnObject
    fun findOrderById(id: String?): Optional<Order?>?
}
----
======

At that point, Spring Security will protect any `Order` returned from `findOrderById` by way of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14596[proxying the `Order` instance].

=== Error Handling - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14598[#14598], https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14600[#14600], https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14601[#14601]

In this release, you can also https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14601[intercept and handle failure at the method level] with its last new method security annotation.

When you xref:servlet/authorization/method-security.adoc#fallback-values-authorization-denied[annotate a method with `@HandleAuthorizationDenied`] like so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
public class Payment {
    @HandleAuthorizationDenied(handlerClass=Mask.class)
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('card:read')")
    public String getCreditCardNumber() { ... }
}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
class Payment {
    @HandleAuthorizationDenied(handlerClass=Mask.class)
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('card:read')")
    fun getCreditCardNumber(): String { ... }
}
----
======

and publish a `Mask` bean:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Component
public class Mask implements MethodAuthorizationDeniedHandler {
	@Override
    public Object handleDeniedInvocation(MethodInvocation invocation, AuthorizationResult result) {
		return "***";
    }
}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Component
class Mask : MethodAuthorizationDeniedHandler {
    fun handleDeniedInvocation(invocation: MethodInvocation?, result: AuthorizationResult?): Any = "***"
}
----
======

then any unauthorized call to `Payment#getCreditCardNumber` will return `\***` instead of the number.

You can see all these features at work together in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/tree/main/servlet/spring-boot/java/data[the latest Spring Security Data sample].

== Compromised Password Checking - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/7395[#7395]

If you are going to let users pick passwords, it's critical to ensure that such a password isn't already compromised.
Spring Security 6.3 makes this as simple as xref:features/authentication/password-storage.adoc#authentication-compromised-password-check[publishing a `CompromisedPasswordChecker` bean]:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public CompromisedPasswordChecker compromisedPasswordChecker() {
    return new HaveIBeenPwnedRestApiPasswordChecker();
}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Bean
fun compromisedPasswordChecker(): CompromisedPasswordChecker = HaveIBeenPwnedRestApiPasswordChecker()
----
======

== `spring-security-rsa` is now part of Spring Security - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/14202[#14202]

Since 2017, Spring Security has been undergoing a long-standing initiative to fold various Spring Security extensions into Spring Security proper.
In 6.3, `spring-security-rsa` becomes the latest of these projects which will help the team maintain and add features to it, long-term.

`spring-security-rsa` provides a number of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/main/crypto/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/crypto/encrypt/RsaSecretEncryptor.java[handy `BytesEncryptor`] https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/main/crypto/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/crypto/encrypt/RsaRawEncryptor.java[implementations] as well as https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/main/crypto/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/crypto/encrypt/KeyStoreKeyFactory.java[a simpler API for working with ``KeyStore``s].


== OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange Grant - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/5199[#5199]

One of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/5199[the most highly-voted OAuth 2.0 features] in Spring Security is now in place in 6.3, which is the support for https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693#section-2[the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange grant].

For xref:servlet/oauth2/client/authorization-grants.adoc#token-exchange-grant-access-token[any client configured for token exchange], you can activate it in Spring Security by adding a `TokenExchangeAuthorizedClientProvider` instance to your `OAuth2AuthorizedClientManager` like so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider tokenExchange() {
	return new TokenExchangeOAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider();
}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Bean
fun tokenExchange(): OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider = TokenExchangeOAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider()
----
======

and then xref:servlet/oauth2/client/authorized-clients.adoc#oauth2Client-registered-authorized-client[use the `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` annotation] as per usual to retrieve the appropriate token with the expanded privileges your resource server needs.
